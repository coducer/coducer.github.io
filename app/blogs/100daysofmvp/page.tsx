                                A Quick and Comprehensive 1 to 100 Days Process Guide

                                The 100 Days Journey of building an MVP is a technophile's dream adventure. It involves creating a basic and functional version of the product quickly with least effort and resources required to validate your assumptions and iterate based on real-world feedback. By focusing only on the most critical features, you can speed up the development process, reduce costs, and get the product to market faster before investing significant resources into the full-scale development.

                                The Four Phases
                                In 100 Days of MVP, we divide the days into 4 Phases for harmonious balance of extensive operations involved in building an MVP.

                                1) 1-20 Days - The Design Phase
                                2) 21-75 Days - The Development Phase
                                3) 76-90 Days - The Launch Phase
                                4) 91-100 Days - Scaling Phase

                                The Design Phase

                                Digital Products that address usersâ€™ needs directly, plainly, and neatly win their heart right away! A well-presented visual layout transforms the overall look and feel of the product in an instant. Accordingly, the first twenty days are entirely focused on designing the visuals of the product.
                                This phase comprises of 4 Weeks

                                Week 1(Day 1 to 5) -  We work on enhancing the User Experience (UX) and Architectural Elements of the MVP, designing data models for structuring and organising data effectively and creating an overall high-level system design plan.
                                Week 2(Day 6 to 10) - We will give you a demo of the progess made and iterations to be made are noted.
                                Week 3(Day 11 to 15) - We will focus on the layout of the visual elements & content and design the user interface for seamless interaction taking the iterations into account.
                                Week 4(Day 15 to 20) - We will give you the final demo of the Design to keep you aligned with the changes and progess made so far.

                                The Development Phase

                                Once the layout design of the product is finalised, our team begins to take on a well-structured development approach for the next 11 Weeks/55 Days. We focus on choosing appropriate open-source technologies and frameworks, customising and integrating solutions to meet project needs and ensuring seamless integration of the components. Meanwhile, weekly updates and biweekly demos are provided to keep you abreast with the advances made to ensure that we are on the same page in terms of design and features.

                                Week 1(Day 21 to 25) - We customise the choice of tools,frameworks and methodology to be used and create a preliminary working model.
                                Week 2(Day 26 to 30) -  A demo is given of the progress and choices made.
                                Week 3(Day 31 to 35) -  The strategy that is finalised is implemented.
                                Week 4(Day 36 to 40) -  A second demo of the working model is given and our First batch of Design(R1) is released.
                                Week 5(Day 41 to 45) -  Further updates are made on the R1 and new features are experimented with to deliver a stellar product.
                                Week 6(Day 46 to 50) -  A third demo is given on the progress made so far.
                                Week 7(Day 51 to 55) -  Compatibility of the open source is ensured for a seamless integration of the functions.
                                Week 8(Day 56 to 60) -  A fourth demo is given Demo and Second Batch of Design(R2) is released.
                                Week 9(Day 61 to 65) -  Further developmental tasks are carried out on the R2.
                                Week 10(Day 66 to 70) - A fifth demo is presented.
                                Week 11(Day 71 to 75) -  We ensure that the product developed is wholesome and aligns with the objective of the customer.

                                The Launch Phase

                                The next organic step after development of the product is to launch the tested and validated product. In this phase, patterns, pain points, and opportunities are analyzed from the feedbacks received. 3 whole weeks are solely dedicated to this.

                                Week 1(Day 76 to 80) -  A Demo of the developed product is given and the Third and Final Batch of Design(R3) is released. The R3 released is the UAT(User Acceptance Testing) Reading, the last stage of Software Development lifecycle.
                                Week 2 and 3(Day 81 to 90) -  Based on user testing, reviews and feedback, observations are noted and iterative improvements are made. Changes are validated and updated versions are further tested.

                                Scaling Phase

                                In the final phase, we help you to scale up the product by building new components or by pivoting existing features based on customer feedback and success in the market. Our primary focus is on prioritising and implementing user-driven enhancements, building new components, expand functionality with new modules, pivoting existing features and adaping them based on market validation, streamlining the processes to optimise performance and scalability, tech workload optimization for heavy workloads and employ rapid development iterations to deliver an outstanding MVP in 100 Days!

                                Week 1(Day 91 to 95) -  Reviewed UAT is submitted after validation and is now ready to be launched.
                                Week 2(Day 96 to 100) - Execute a launch plan on designated platforms, finalise the product and the fully functional MVP is successfully deployed and goes live.

                                The 100 days of MVP building approach emphasizes speed, efficiency, and responsiveness to user needs. It's important to note that while the 100-day timeframe is arbitrary, the key idea is to set a fixed timeline and focus on delivering a functional product with a clear value proposition within that timeframe. The key to a successful MVP is to keep it simple, focus on the core value proposition, and iterate based on user feedback to improve the product continually.
