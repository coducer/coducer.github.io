Data science plays a vital role in our day to day lives and can be used for various applications. We at Coducer, are well versed and proficient with Data Science and its implementations. Here is a brief guide on how to solve a problem faced in the Healthcare industry that has started exploring Data Science.

A Healthcare service provider works to connect patients with doctors. The facility works in a way that the patient’s medical history and the doctor’s services would be matched accordingly. This would be done by a data aggregator who has trained models.

The healthcare service provider depends on the data provided by the aggregator. It’s based on this data that the service provider matches patients with the right doctors.

Problem:
----------------------
The data available with the healthcare provider is messed up due to this. Let's remember that it has a critical impact on business operations.
There are two parts of the problem that must be addressed in this context. Let's take a look at the problem and its genesis.

        1. The healthcare service provider did not sync their data with the data aggregator for  two years. 
        2. The sync was done by dumping data without realizing that the format changed.
        3. Apart from that, the data aggregator has changed the data format, which has made syncing. 
        4. This makes syncing difficult as the old and new formats are different, now.

Solution:
---------------
        1.The data available is to be collected. This is irrespective of whether it’s valid or invalid, useful or not.
        2.It’s then cleaned and filtered to retain only useful and valid data which matches the Data Aggregator’s Portal.
        3.After that, it’s linked up with the Portal ID and other parameters of the Data Aggregator. (This must ensure that it’s matching the new form-at).
        4.Once the matching is done, it becomes possible to sync it and get the data, updated in real-time.
